1#Python
#is a high level programming language that uses instructions to teach the computer how to perform a task

2#Program
#is a set of instructions that tells the computer to perform a speciifc task

3#IDE (Integrated Development Environment
#is a Software application that provides comprehensive facilities to Computer Programmers for Software Development

4#Comments
#are pieces of code which are ignored by Python Interpreter
#Anything written after # is considered as Comment

5#String
#is a sequence of Characters
#Anything written between the 'Single Quote' or 'Double Quote' is a String in Python

6#Operators
#are used to perform Operations on Variables & Values

7#Variables
#act as Containers to store values.These values can be anything,from numbers to text or entire functions.

8#Data Types
#Variables can store data of different types & different types can do different things.
#Python has following data types builtin by default
#Text Type:str
#Numeric Type:int,float,complex
#Sequence Type:list,tuple,range
#Mapping Type:dict
#Set Type:Set,frozenset
#Boolean Type:bool
#Binary Type:bytes,byte array,memoryview
#None Type:nonetype

9#Comparision & Logical Operators
#Comparision operators are used to compare two values
#Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements

10#Type Conversions
#The process of converting the value of one data type(integer,string,float etc) to another data type is called type conversion.
#Python has two types of type Conversion
# Implicit & Explicit Type Conversion

#Implicit Type Conversion
#Python automatically convert one data type to another data type.This process doesn't need any user involvement.

#Explicit Type Conversion
#users convert the data type of an object to required data type.

11#If,Else,Elif Statements
#Decision making is required when we want to execute a code only if a certain condition is certified
#The if,elif,else statement is used in Python for decision making

12#Functions
#is a block of code which only runs when it is called
#You can pass data,Known as parameters,into a function.
#A function can return data as a result
#In python function is defined using the def Keyword

13#Loops
#pyhton has two Primitive Loop Commands
#While & For Loop

#While Loop
#With the while loop we can execute as a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
#With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true
#With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration,and continue with the next
#With the else statement we can run a block code once when the condition no longer is true

#For Loop
#A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence.
#With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items
#With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration from the loop,and continue with the next

14#Libraries
#Python has a built in module that you can use for mathematical tasks
#Python has a built in module that you can use to calculate mathematical statistics of numerica data
